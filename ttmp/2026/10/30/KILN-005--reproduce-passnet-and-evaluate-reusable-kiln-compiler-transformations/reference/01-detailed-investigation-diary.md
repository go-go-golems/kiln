# Detailed investigation diary

## Step 1: Establish an isolated reproduction workspace and primary sources

Created branch `research/passnet` and its worktree, then created KILN-005 using docmgr. Downloaded the arXiv paper and Hugging Face file inventory into the ticket sources directory. The prior goal turn made progress by creating these authoritative artifacts; no reproduction measurement has occurred yet.

### Prompt Context
**User prompt (verbatim):** "store the information in the ticket too as a source/ document, and download all the erelevant material you need and find (if you need to search) into the sources/ folder too."
**Assistant interpretation:** Archive the supplied research and primary references alongside the implementation guide.
**Inferred user intent:** Make the experiment independently reviewable and reproducible. The larger original request is available in the conversation; full source transcription remains pending.

### What I did
- Created the requested worktree after an approved sandbox escalation for Git metadata.
- Created the ticket, guide skeleton, and this diary with docmgr.
- Downloaded paper.pdf, extracted paper.txt with pdftotext, and saved dataset-files.json.
- Inspected scripts/kiln-export.mjs and runtime/python/kiln_launch.py.

### Why
- Preserve the unmodified reference experiment separately from Kiln integration.
- Verify preliminary API and protocol claims before implementing them.

### What worked
- Paper Table 3 confirms A30 24 GB, CUDA 12.8, PyTorch 2.9.1+cu128, Triton 3.5.1, 20 warmups, 100 trials, and rerun at IQR greater than 20% of median.
- Kiln exposes open_program and CudaProgram.launch with caller pointers and stream; the export CLI supports an a100 target.

### What didn't work
- Default sandbox download: `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: arxiv.org`; escalation enabled the paper and inventory downloads.
- First worktree attempt: `fatal: cannot lock ref 'refs/heads/research/passnet': unable to create directory for .git/refs/heads/research/passnet`; approved escalation resolved it.
- Reference clone used the configured SSH rewrite and stalled. A second clone explicitly prefers HTTPS and is being observed before further recovery.
- `nvidia-smi`: `command not found`. Local CUDA execution capability is unproven.

### What I learned
- Local Node is v24.18.0, while package.json requires Node >=26. Resolve this before claiming supported-environment validation.
- Dataset inventory contains 14 Parquet shards; the first is 661,340,081 bytes. Inventory download is not dataset download.

### What was tricky to build
- Network and Git metadata require sandbox escalation. Source downloads must live under the ticket rather than a repository-level scratch directory.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- Scoring implementation, integrity constraints, supported dtype/layout semantics, and exact task split need direct source inspection.

### What should be done in the future
- Preserve the complete user research as a source document, finish upstream archive and dataset acquisition, pin revisions and hashes, and write the intern guide.
- Establish CPU validation and GPU execution resources before baseline and bridge measurements.

### Code review instructions
- Inspect sources/paper.txt Table 3 and the dataset inventory; compare scripts/kiln-export.mjs and runtime/python/kiln_launch.py with the guide once written.

### Technical details
- Worktree: /home/manuel/code/wesen/kiln/worktrees/passnet.
- Reference paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2605.29357, v1 dated 28 May 2026.
- Runtime launch signature: launch(stream=0, scratch=None, **pointers).

## Step 2: Pin sources and establish DGX Spark execution access

Resolved immutable reference revisions and started the complete dataset download in tmux with SHA256 verification against Hugging Face LFS metadata. Archived the user research as an explicitly condensed source document rather than presenting it as a verbatim transcript.

### Prompt Context
**User prompt (verbatim):** "you can use bling.local: which is a DGX spark to run your workfloads"
**Assistant interpretation:** Use the existing DGX Spark for GPU execution.
**Inferred user intent:** Remove local hardware limitations without reducing implementation scope.

### What I did
- Inspected bling.local through SSH: GB10, ARM64, driver 580.178.04 reporting CUDA capability 13.0, Docker 29.6.2, Python 3.12.3, Node 26.8.1, 3.4 TB available.
- Pinned PassNet develop to 61c64709f6d324216ae8252cec3cdc35b2dd5da5 and dataset to 4f7dd9211178327c2718f1b828d83ea126186f9e.
- Added scripts/01-download-dataset.py; launched tmux session passnet-dataset with persistent log.

### Why
- Immutable downloads and checksum verification establish source provenance.
- Keep large material locally under sources while committing inventories, scripts and receipts.

### What worked
- SSH host inspection succeeded. Dataset first shard reached 239 MB during observation; no completed dataset claim yet.

### What didn't work
- Git clone remains slow or stalled; independent pinned codeload archive is downloading. Neither an observation timeout nor a directory proves completion.

### What I learned
- DGX Spark differs from the paper A30 in GPU architecture, host architecture and software. Report this as a hardware-port reproduction.
- NVIDIA-SMI CUDA version is driver capability, not proof of installed toolkit or PyTorch CUDA support.

### What was tricky to build
- Pinned source archive avoids depending on configured SSH URL rewrites without changing global Git configuration.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- ARM64/Blackwell compatibility with pinned PyTorch/Triton and benchmark defenses.

### What should be done in the future
- Inspect remote containers and CUDA-enabled Python, complete downloads, materialize dataset safely, and write the guide against executable source contracts.
- User explicitly authorizes implementing missing Kiln capabilities with design documentation and diary entries; do not redefine success as a restricted subset.

### Code review instructions
- Review the downloader's size/hash checks and revision metadata before trusting the corpus.

### Technical details
- Dataset receipt is written only after each shard verifies; interrupted partial files are not valid shards.

## Step 3: Verify CUDA execution and document implementation contracts

Wrote the first substantive intern guide against the paper, pinned PassBench README and current Kiln runtime/compiler sources. Verified real CUDA tensor execution in an existing DGX Spark container; this proves execution availability but not PassBench compatibility.

### Prompt Context
**User prompt (verbatim):** "Don't hesitate to look at pytorch or passnet or research or so if there is something that needs to be ported to kiln, make sure to properly document it though in the diary so we can keep track of where what is coming from"
**Assistant interpretation:** Consult upstream implementations and research as necessary, preserving exact provenance for every port.
**Inferred user intent:** Build missing capabilities with an auditable implementation history.

### What I did
- Archived pinned PassBench and PassAgent READMEs in sources/upstream-readmes.
- Added guide sections covering graph/task structure, pass module API, corpus materialization, numerical checking, runtime ownership, importer semantics, policy experiments and delivery gates.
- Ran a CUDA tensor calculation in localhost:5000/playback-redaction:base-26.05 on bling.local.

### Why
- Executable environment verification resolves the hardware uncertainty before implementation.
- Design boundaries prevent silent dtype/layout errors and invalid benchmark comparisons.

### What worked
- Container reported PyTorch 2.12.0a0+5aff3928d8.nv26.05, Triton 3.7.0, CUDA 13.2, NVIDIA GB10, capability (12,1).
- CUDA arange squared and copied to CPU produced [0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49].
- Verified mergeLoopOps guard in packages/kiln/src/std/loop.js is now <= was * 1.02.

### What didn't work
- No new failures; full source and dataset acquisition remain in progress, not complete.

### What I learned
- Existing usable GPU environment differs materially from paper versions. Record both hardware and software deviations.
- The pinned README confirms 25 warmups and squared-slowdown prose, requiring reconciliation with paper settings and scorer code.

### What was tricky to build
- Asynchronous CUDA pointers require tensor lifetime, context and stream ownership; guide identifies these as integration contracts requiring GPU tests.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- Corpus materialization safety, exact ATen semantics, score parameters and benchmark integrity restrictions.

### What should be done in the future
- Complete source extraction and corpus acquisition; inspect executable evaluator and materialize dataset; implement bridge against genuine tasks.
- Every port must record upstream URL, revision, path, symbol, license, adaptation and validation evidence. No code has been ported in this step.

### Code review instructions
- Read design-doc/01-passnet-reproduction-and-kiln-integration-intern-guide.md alongside the archived PassBench README and runtime/python/kiln_launch.py.

### Technical details
- CUDA smoke test used a disposable docker run --rm --gpus all invocation, with no host Python installation changes.
