# Diary

## Goal

Merge six Kiln implementation branches (KILN-011, 009, 010, 008, 006, 007, in that order) into one integration branch `integration/kiln-006-011`, created from `research/passnet` at `373766b`. Each merge is one `--no-ff` merge commit, conflicts are resolved by keeping both features' semantics, and both test suites pass after every merge:

```
(cd packages/kiln && npm test) ; (cd integrations/passnet && python3 -m pytest -q)
```

Baseline at `373766b`: `npm test` all 48 passed; `pytest` 177 passed, 7 subtests passed.

Test logs live in the scratch directory `/tmp/claude-1000/-home-manuel-code-wesen-kiln-worktrees-passnet/cd5f3680-095d-4dc0-be9b-3833056c7f6a/scratchpad/integration/` as `<tag>-npm.log` and `<tag>-py.log` (written by `runtests.sh <tag>` in the same directory).

## Step 1: Merge KILN-011 (integer floor division and modulo)

KILN-011 went first because it touches the shared typed-arithmetic core (exact int64 literals in the loop-level folder, the dtype of folded splat constants, the CUDA helper table) that KILN-010 also edits. The merge was clean: git's three-way merge reported no conflicts, and both suites passed without changes.

### Prompt Context
**User prompt (verbatim):** "yes, still free" (in reply to the coordinator proposing: merge in the order 011, 009 → 010 → 008, 006 → 007 with tests at every step on an integration branch, then GPU jobs on bling serially).
**Assistant interpretation:** The coordinator delegated the merges to this agent: merge the six branches in the stated order, resolve conflicts preserving both sides, keep tests green after each merge, keep a diary, local commits only, no GPU work.
**Inferred user intent:** Get one branch carrying all six features, with confidence that no feature was lost in conflict resolution, so the GPU validation jobs can run against a single integrated tree.
**Commit (code):** see the merge commit "Merge KILN-011: integer floordiv/mod" (hash recorded in Step 7).

### What I did
- Read the KILN-011 design-doc Section 13 (implementation notes) and the diary step index (Steps 7-12).
- `git merge --no-ff --no-commit impl/kiln-011-floordiv-mod` — no conflicts. Touched `fx_import.py`, `emit.js` (`cudaHelpers` collection from `FNS[*].helper`), `fns.js` (`CUDA_HELPERS`, division functions), `kernel.js`, `loop.js` (exact literals, `foldSplatView`/`foldSplatEw` keep dtype), `tensor.js` (`resolveEw` and the N API), new tests `integer-division.mjs`, `float-division.mjs`, `integer-constant-folding.mjs`.
- Ran both suites.

### Why
- 011 has no overlap with 009 in source and is the base that 010's duplicated foldSplat fix gets reconciled against in Step 3.

### What worked
- `npm test`: all 51 passed (48 + 3 new). `pytest`: 180 passed, 7 subtests passed.

### What didn't work
- No failures observed.

### What I learned
- KILN-011's Phase 0 also fixed `Math.fround` rounding every literal operand in the serial evaluator; this matters for the KILN-010 constant index-value fold later (its ±2^24 guard).

### What was tricky to build
- Nothing in this merge.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- N/A for this merge (unchanged branch content).

### What should be done in the future
- N/A.

### Code review instructions
- `git show --stat <merge>`; `packages/kiln/src/std/loop.js` foldSplatView/foldSplatEw, `packages/kiln/src/std/fns.js` CUDA_HELPERS.

### Technical details
- Logs: `m011-npm.log`, `m011-py.log`.
